Feature: Coloring

Will color the character's sprites in accordance to the attributes given.


The different colors are defined in the class variable 'matrix_map'.
Each color is mapped by an attribute name that should be added to your layeredimages as followed:

group autofocus_coloring:
    attribute day default null
    attribute dawn null
    attribute sunset null
    ...

and so on with every matrix defined.


to use it in game, just show the character with one of the attribute in the aformentionned group
ie

show eileen dawn

as simple as that


If the version of Ren'Py is prior to 7.4.0, then this feature will automatically be disabled, as the ATL property 'matrixcolor' has yet to be implemented.
