Feature: Autofilter

When a character doesn't talk, their sprite will darken. And of course when this character speaks, its brightness will return to normal, and vice-versa.


allowed user-arguments:
focused_level (when the character speaks)          defaults to 0.0
unfocused_level (when the character doesn't speak) defaults to -0.1
duration                                           defaults to 0.25
warper                                             defaults to None, changed into easein


If the version of Ren'Py is one prior to 7.4.0, then this feature will automatically be disabled, as the ATL property 'matrixcolor' has yet to be implemented.
