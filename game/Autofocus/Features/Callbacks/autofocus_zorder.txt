Feature: Autozorder

When a character talks, if the conditions are met (here, if the variable AutofocusStore.autofocus_zorder is enabled
and that there are at least as many characters showing as the variable AutofocusStore.autofocus_zoom_zorder_minimum_char_requirement),
then the character's zorder will change to 3.

And of course when another character speaks, the character's zorder will be set to 2.


The zorder value when talking is passed in super(AutofocusZorder, self).__init__ as the begin_parameter argument.
The zorder value when not talking is passed in super(AutofocusZorder, self).__init__ as the end_parameter argument.
