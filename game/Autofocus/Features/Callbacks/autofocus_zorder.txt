Feature: Autozorder

The character's zorder will change to 3 when talking. And of course when another character speaks, the character's zorder will be set to 2.

This feature can be turned on / off with the store variable `AutofocusStore.autofocus_zorder`.


as of now, you can't pass arguments to classes used for callbacks
