Feature: Automouth

The character's mouth will be set to 'begin_parameter' when talking if it doesn't already have another mouth applied, and when another character speaks, the character's mouth will be set to 'end_parameter' if it doesn't already have another mouth applied.

allowed user-arguments:
begin_parameter (when the character speaks)      defaults to 'om'
end_parameter (when the character doesn't speak) defaults to 'cm'
=======
This feature can be turned on / off with the store variable `AutofocusStore.autofocus_mouth`.
Do note that `AutofocusStore.autofocus_mouth` defaults to `False` as to avoid confusing errors.

If the version of Ren'Py is prior to 7.0, then this feature will automatically be disabled, as layeredimages have yet to be implemented.
