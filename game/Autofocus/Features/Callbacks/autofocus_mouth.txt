Feature: Automouth

When a character talks, if the conditions are met (here, if the variable AutofocusStore.autofocus_mouth is enabled
and that mouths attibutes haven't been set manually), then the character's mouth will be set to 'om'.

And of course when another character speaks, the character's mouth will be set to 'cm'.


The opened mouth attribute when talking is passed in super(AutofocusZorder, self).__init__ as the begin_parameter argument.
The closed mouth attribute when not talking is passed in super(AutofocusZorder, self).__init__ as the end_parameter argument.


If the version of Ren'Py is prior to 7.0, then this feature will automatically be disabled, as layeredimages have yet to be implemented.



if you have no idea what in the hell 'om' and 'cm' are, i'd advice you to take a look at the Doki Doki Literature Club MPT https://github.com/chronoshag/DDLCMPT.
