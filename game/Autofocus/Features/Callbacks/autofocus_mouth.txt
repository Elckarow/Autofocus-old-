Feature: Automouth

The character's mouth will be set to 'om' when talking if it doesn't already have another mouth applied. And of course when another character speaks, the character's mouth will be set to 'cm'.

This feature can be turned on / off with the store variable `AutofocusStore.autofocus_mouth`.


If the version of Ren'Py is prior to 7.0, then this feature will automatically be disabled, as layeredimages have yet to be implemented.



if you have no idea what in the hell 'om' and 'cm' are, i'd advice you to take a look at the Doki Doki Literature Club MPT https://github.com/chronoshag/DDLCMPT.

as of now, you can't pass arguments to classes used in callbacks.
