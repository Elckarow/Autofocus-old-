Feature: DropShadow

Adds a drop shadow effect to the character's sprites.

This feature can be turned on / off with the store variable `AutofocusStore.autofocus_dropshadow`.
The persitent `persistent.autofocus_drop_shadow` can also be used to allow the player to choose rendering with
the drop shadow effect when it's on (as a toggle button in the `preference` screen for instance).


allowed arguments:
xoffset              defaults to 0
yoffset              defaults to 0
offset               optional, will override both xoffset and yoffset if passed
blur                 defaults to 10
color                defaults to "#000" (black)
brightness           defaults to 1.0


If the version of Ren'Py is prior to 7.4.0, this feature will automatically be disabled, as the ATL property 'matrixcolor' has yet to be implemented.
