xoffset              defaults to 0
yoffset              defaults to 0
offset               optional, will override both xoffset and yoffset if passed

If the version of Ren'Py is prior to 7.4.0, this feature will automatically be disabled, as the ATL property 'matrixcolor' has yet to be implemented.
