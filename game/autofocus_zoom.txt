Feature: Autozoom

When a character talks, if the conditions are met (here, if the variable AutofocusStore.autofocus_zoom is enabled
and that there are at least as many characters showing as the variable AutofocusStore.autofocus_zoom_zorder_minimum_char_requirement),
then the character will zoom in.

And of course when another character speaks, the character zoomed in will return to its normal zoom.


The character will zoom in over 0.5 seconds, as defined in the variable 'self.duration'.
The zooming will use the warper 'easein'.
