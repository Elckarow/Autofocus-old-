Feature: Autofilter

When a character talks, if the conditions are met (here, if the variable AutofocusStore.autofocus_zoom is enabled and that config.gl2 is enabled),
then the character will darken when they aren't talking.

And of course when this character speaks, its brightness will return to normal, and vice-versa.


The character will darken in over 0.25 seconds, as defined in the variable 'self.duration'.
The zooming will use the warper 'easein'.


If the version of Ren'Py is prior to 7.4.0, then this feature will automatically be disabled, as the ATL property 'matrixcolor' has yet to be implemented.
