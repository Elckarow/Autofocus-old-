# Autofocus
A Ren'Py tool that aims at making character dialogues less of a chore to write.





As of now the tool contains 5 features (and only works for Ren'Py 7):

`Autozoom`
-zooms the character in when they are speaking.

`Autozorder`
-changes the character's zorder when they are speaking.

`Autofilter`
-darkens the character when they are not speaking.

`Automouth`
-changes the character's mouth when they are speaking. (see the Doki Doki Literature Club's Mood Posing Tool for more details)

`Coloring`
-colors the character.

a more in-depth guide of each feature is included in the package.
