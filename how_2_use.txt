1) copy everything into your 'game' folder

########################

2) take a look at each in-depth guide to make sure you understand how each feature works

this one is very important: take a look inside `01AutofocusDisplayable.rpy` and `01OverridesAndOtherStuff.rpy`. a lot of things are explained in here.

########################

3) below your layeredimages definitions, add the following 'at AutofocusDisplayable(name="<character image tag>")'
ie

layeredimage eileen:
    at AutofocusDisplayable(name="eileen")
    
    
custom parameters can be passed. please take a look at the corresponding in-depth guide to know which parameter can be passed
to pass a custom argument, use the subclass name, followed by an underscore, then the argument name
ie

layeredimage eileen:
    at AutofocusDisplayable(name="eileen", AutofocusDropShadow_blur=20)

########################

4) in the case where every condition is met but you still can't use a feature, please take a look at `log.txt`. some features are automatically disabled for renpy versions that do not support them
