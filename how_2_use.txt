THIS 2) PART IS NO LONGER NEEDED

2) define your characters using the functions provided with the tooll
so if you used to do

define eileen = Character("Eileen", image="eileen")

do instead

define eileen = AutofocusCharacter("Eileen", image="eileen")

same with DynamicCharacters

define eileen = DynamicCharacter("e_name", image="eileen")
define eileen = AutofocusDynamicCharacter("e_name", image="eileen")

########################

3) below your layeredimages definitions, add the following 'at AutofocusDisplayable(name="<character image tag>")'
ie

layeredimage eileen forward:
    at AutofocusDisplayable(name="eileen")

4) take a look at each in-depth guide to make sure you understand how each feature works

########################

5) in the case where every condition is met but you still can't use a feature, please take a look at `log.txt`. some features are automatically disabled for renpy versions that do not support them
