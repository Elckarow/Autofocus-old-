2) take a look at each in-depth guide to make sure you understand how each feature works

this one is very important: take a look inside `01AutofocusDisplayable.rpy`, `01OverridesAndOtherStuff.rpy` and `01AutofocusStore.rpy`.
a lot of things are explained in here.

3) below your layeredimages definitions, add the following 'at AutofocusDisplayable(name="<character image tag>")'
ie

layeredimage eileen happy:
    at AutofocusDisplayable(name="eileen happy")
    
    
custom parameters can be passed. please take a look at the corresponding in-depth guide to know which parameter can be passed
to pass a custom argument, use the subclass name, followed by an underscore, then the argument name
ie

layeredimage eileen:
    at AutofocusDisplayable(name="eileen", AutofocusDropShadow_blur=20)
